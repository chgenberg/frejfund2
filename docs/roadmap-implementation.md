# Roadmap Implementation Status

## Current State (October 2025)

The roadmap feature (`/roadmap` page) is currently in a **template/demo state**:

### What Works:

- ✅ Dynamic roadmap generation based on selected goal
- ✅ Beautiful UI with progress bars and animations
- ✅ Different roadmaps for different goals (e.g., "Find investors", "Launch product")
- ✅ Month-by-month breakdown with specific tasks
- ✅ Responsive design with collapsible sections

### What's NOT Implemented Yet:

- ❌ Database persistence (no saving of progress)
- ❌ Task completion tracking
- ❌ Real progress calculation
- ❌ User-specific roadmaps
- ❌ Task editing or customization
- ❌ Notifications/reminders
- ❌ Integration with calendar

### Data Structure:

The roadmap is generated in `src/lib/goal-system.ts` using templates:

```typescript
{
  months: [
    {
      title: 'Month 1 - Foundation',
      description: 'Get your materials ready',
      weeks: 'Weeks 1-4',
      tasks: [{ id: string, title: string, description: string, completed: false }],
    },
  ];
}
```

### To Make It Functional:

1. Add Prisma schema for roadmaps/tasks
2. Create API endpoints for CRUD operations
3. Add state management (Zustand/Context)
4. Implement task completion logic
5. Add progress calculation
6. Connect to user sessions

### Why It Shows 0% Progress:

- All tasks have `completed: false` by default
- No database connection to save state
- Progress is calculated as: `completedTasks / totalTasks * 100`

This is intentional for the demo/prototype phase.
