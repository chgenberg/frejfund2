## How It Works

### Phase 1: Initial Scraping
1. Scrape website content
2. Extract text from uploaded documents
3. Parse LinkedIn profiles

### Phase 2: Deep Analysis (Background)
For each dimension:
1. Run GPT analysis with specific prompt
2. Extract structured findings
3. Identify red flags and strengths
4. Generate relevant questions to ask founder

### Phase 3: Knowledge Graph Construction
Build a comprehensive profile with:
- Scores for each dimension (0-100)
- Findings and evidence
- Gaps and missing information
- Intelligent questions to fill gaps

### Phase 4: Freja Intelligence Activation
Freja can now:
- Reference specific findings: "I noticed your CAC is $500 but LTV is only $300..."
- Ask targeted questions: "Your website mentions enterprise clients, but what's your actual sales cycle?"
- Challenge assumptions: "You claim 10% market share, but I only see 100 customers and a $10B TAM..."
- Suggest priorities: "Before pitching investors, you need to fix your unit economics"

## Priority System

- **Critical (12)**: Must-have for any investor pitch
- **High (15)**: Very important, will be questioned
- **Medium (12)**: Nice to have, shows maturity
- **Low (5)**: Bonus points, differentiation

## Example Intelligent Behaviors

### Scenario 1: Missing Critical Data
```
Freja: "I see you have revenue traction, but I'm missing your burn rate 
and CAC. Without these, I can't assess if your growth is sustainable. 
Can you share these numbers?"
```

### Scenario 2: Data Contradictions
```
Freja: "You mentioned you're growth-stage, but $5K MRR is typically 
early revenue-stage. Most growth-stage companies have $100K+ MRR. 
Should we recalibrate your stage?"
```

### Scenario 3: Industry-Specific Probing
```
Freja: "For a SaaS business, I need to understand: What's your net 
revenue retention rate? This is critical for investors evaluating SaaS 
companies. Target is 110%+."
```

### Scenario 4: Pitch Deck Quality
```
Freja: "I reviewed your deck. Slide 5 talks about 'disrupting the market' 
but doesn't show HOW. Can you clarify your specific competitive advantage?"
```
