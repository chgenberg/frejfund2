### Deep Analysis Integration
- [ ] After analysis completes, auto-build tree
- [ ] In `deep-analysis-runner.ts`:
  ```typescript
  const tree = await buildReadinessTree(sessionId);
  // Auto-save to DB
  ```
- [ ] Test with real analysis data

### Freja Coaching Integration
- [ ] Fetch tree in chat context

### Email Reporting
- [ ] Weekly email template with tree summary
- [ ] "Your score: X%, Focus on: Y branch"
- [ ] "Next step: Z with timeline"
- [ ] Click-through to dashboard

### Analytics & Tracking
- [ ] Log which branches founders interact with
- [ ] Track time spent on each branch
- [ ] Measure time to "investor ready"
- [ ] Correlate tree score with funding outcomes

## Phase 5: Future Enhancements (BACKLOG üîÆ)

### Personalization
- [ ] AI-powered guidance per branch (via Freja)
- [ ] Founder stage-specific recommendations
- [ ] Industry-specific branch priorities
- [ ] Peer comparison ("You vs similar startups")

### Resources & Templates
- [ ] Pitch deck template library
- [ ] Financial model templates
- [ ] Cap table template
- [ ] GTM strategy template
- [ ] Due diligence document template

### VC Integration
- [ ] Auto-generate founder profile from tree
- [ ] "Investor ready" profile goes to VC dashboard
- [ ] Investor-facing branch priorities
- [ ] "What matters most to Series A investors?"

### Advanced Tracking
- [ ] Version history of tree scores
- [ ] Week-by-week progress chart
- [ ] Peer benchmarking
- [ ] Industry trends (what branches matter most?)

### Automations
- [ ] Batch operations ("Get all branches to 80%")
- [ ] Smart nudges ("You're stuck on Traction, let's fix it")
- [ ] Calendar integration (sync recommended timeline)
- [ ] Document linking (auto-detect uploaded pitch deck)

## Testing Checklist

### Unit Tests (TODO)
- [ ] `buildReadinessTree()` with mock data
- [ ] `getBranchGuidance()` with various branches
- [ ] `summarizeReadinessTree()` with different scores
- [ ] Score calculation edge cases

### Integration Tests (TODO)
- [ ] API endpoint with real analysis
- [ ] Components render without errors
- [ ] Freja chat integration
- [ ] Email generation

### Manual Testing (TODO)
- [ ] Founder journey end-to-end
- [ ] All 5 branches displayable
- [ ] Components responsive on mobile
- [ ] API error handling
- [ ] Deep analysis ‚Üí tree flow

### Load Testing (TODO)
- [ ] Concurrent tree builds
- [ ] Large founder datasets
- [ ] API response time < 500ms

---

## Success Metrics (Post-Launch)

### User Engagement
- How many founders view the tree? (goal: 80%+)
- Average time on tree page? (goal: 5+ min)
- Click rate on branches? (goal: 70%+)
- Checklist completion rate? (goal: 60%+)

### Actionability
- Do founders know what to do next? (survey: target 80%+)
- How many take recommended actions? (goal: 70%+)
- Time to "needs work" status? (goal: 2-3 weeks)
- Time to "investor ready"? (goal: 4-6 weeks)

### Impact
- Do tree-guided founders raise faster? (A/B test)
- Correlation between tree score + funding? (data analysis)
- Retention improvement? (compare to old analysis view)

---

## Known Limitations & TODOs

### Current Limitations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Tree is read-only (can't update items directly yet)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No templating system (links to examples are static)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No peer comparison (single founder view)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Tree rebuilds only when analysis runs (not real-time)

### Nice-to-Haves
- üéØ Manual override of item status by founder
- üéØ Upload templates directly from tree
- üéØ Share tree with advisors/coaches
- üéØ Collaborative editing (co-founder feedback)
- üéØ Historical tracking (compare weeks)
