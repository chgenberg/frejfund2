Here's how to find the best path:

**1. Check LinkedIn (easiest):**
‚Ä¢ Go to ${investorName}'s LinkedIn profile
‚Ä¢ Look at "Mutual Connections"
‚Ä¢ Pick the strongest connection (colleague, friend, advisor)

**2. Ask your network:**
‚Ä¢ Post in founder Slack groups: "Anyone know ${investorName} at ${investorFirm}?"
‚Ä¢ Ask your investors/advisors if they have connections
‚Ä¢ Check if any customers/partners know them

**3. Common intro paths:**
‚Ä¢ Previous investors (if you've raised before)
‚Ä¢ Accelerator mentors (YC, Techstars, etc.)
‚Ä¢ Industry advisors
‚Ä¢ Portfolio company founders (reach out to founders they've backed)

**4. When you find a connector:**
Say: "I found [Name]! Draft warm intro request"
I'll write the perfect message for you.

**No mutual connections?**
‚Ä¢ Engage with their content on LinkedIn first (thoughtful comments)
‚Ä¢ Reference their blog posts/podcasts in your cold email
‚Ä¢ Attend events where they're speaking

Need help with any of these steps?`;
