# ðŸš€ PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT - Final Checklist

## PRE-DEPLOYMENT VERIFICATION (5 minuter)

### Steg 1: Lokalt test
```bash
cd /Users/christophergenberg/Desktop/frejfund-2.0

# 1. Klar databaskonfiguration
echo "DATABASE_URL: $DATABASE_URL" | head -c 50

# 2. TypeScript compile
npx tsc --noEmit

# 3. Build success
npm run build

# Expected: "âœ“ Ready in XXXs"
```

### Steg 2: Verifiera alla filer existerar
```bash
# Core files
ls src/lib/readiness-tree-builder.ts
ls src/app/api/readiness-tree/route.ts
ls src/components/ReadinessTreeViewer.tsx
ls src/components/ReadinessActionPlanner.tsx

# All should exist âœ…
```

---

## GIT PREPARATION (5 minuter)

### Steg 1: Status Check
```bash
git status

# Should be clean (no uncommitted changes)
```

### Steg 2: Stage All Changes
```bash
git add .

# Verify
git status

# Should show:
# On branch main
# Changes to be committed:
#   (additions and modifications)
```

### Steg 3: Commit with Proper Message
```bash
git commit -m "feat: Add Investor Readiness Tree system

- Add 68-dimension analysis to 5-branch tree visualization
- Implement ReadinessTreeViewer and ActionPlanner components
- Add /api/readiness-tree endpoint with GET/POST methods
- Create database models for trees, branches, and items
- Integrate Freja AI coaching with tree data
- Add comprehensive documentation and deployment guides

This system guides founders through exactly what's needed to become 100% investor-ready."
```

### Steg 4: Verify Commit
```bash
git log --oneline -1

# Should show your commit at the top
```

---

## PRODUCTION PUSH (2 minuter)

### Steg 1: Push to Main
```bash
git push origin main

# Output should show:
# Enumerating objects: XX
# Writing objects: 100% (XX/XX)
# To github.com:your-repo/frejfund.git
#    xxxxx...xxxxx  main -> main
```

### Steg 2: Verify Push Success
```bash
# Check GitHub/GitLab
# Branch 'main' should be up to date

# Or from terminal:
git status

# Should show:
# On branch main
# Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
```

---

## VERCEL DEPLOYMENT (Auto, ~3 minuter)

### What Happens Automatically:
1. âœ… Vercel detects push to main
2. âœ… Pulls latest code
3. âœ… Runs `npm run build`
4. âœ… Deploys to production
5. âœ… Available at your production URL

### Monitor Deployment:

**Via Vercel Dashboard:**
```
1. Open https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click your FrejFund project
3. Watch "Deployments" tab
4. Status should go: "Building..." â†’ "Ready âœ…"
```

**Check Your Terminal:**
```bash
# You'll see notifications via GitHub
# or check Vercel Dashboard directly
```

---

## DATABASE MIGRATION IN PRODUCTION (IMPORTANT!)

### IF This is First Time:

You need to run the migration on production database:

**Option 1: Via Vercel (Recommended)**
```bash
# Go to Vercel project settings
# Environment variables should have: DATABASE_URL

# Then run:
npm run build
npx prisma migrate deploy

# This happens during build automatically
```

**Option 2: Manual Migration**
```bash
# Set production DB URL
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://prod-user:pass@prod-host/frejfund"

# Run migration
npx prisma migrate deploy

# Verify
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name LIKE 'readiness_%';"
```

**Verify Migration Success:**
```sql
-- Connect to production DB
SELECT COUNT(*) as readiness_tables FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_name LIKE 'readiness_%';

-- Should return: 3 tables
-- readiness_trees
-- readiness_branches
-- readiness_items
```

---

## VERIFICATION AFTER DEPLOYMENT (5 minuter)

### Steg 1: Check Deployment Status
```bash
# Open your production URL
open https://your-production-domain.com

# Should load without errors
```

### Steg 2: Test API Endpoint
```bash
# Test the readiness-tree API
curl "https://your-production-domain.com/api/readiness-tree?sessionId=test"

# Expected response:
# {"error":"No analysis found for this session..."}
# 
# This is correct! Means API is working
```

### Steg 3: Verify in Browser
```
1. Go to https://your-production-domain.com
2. Start analysis flow
3. Complete business wizard
4. Wait for deep analysis
5. Verify Readiness Tree appears with:
   âœ… 5 branches
   âœ… Progress bars
   âœ… Scores
   âœ… Action planner tabs
```

### Steg 4: Test Freja Integration
```
1. In chat, type: "What should I focus on?"
2. Freja should respond with:
   - Current readiness score
   - Top priorities
   - Timeline
   - Next steps
```

### Steg 5: Monitor Sentry
```bash
# Check for errors
open https://sentry.io/your-project/

# Should see no new errors related to readiness tree
# Any 404s are expected (no analysis run yet)
```

---

## ROLLBACK PLAN (If Needed)

### If Something Goes Wrong:

```bash
# See previous deployments
git log --oneline -5

# Revert to previous commit
git revert HEAD

# Push revert
git push origin main

# Vercel will auto-deploy the revert
```

---

## MONITORING CHECKLIST

Post-deployment, monitor these:

```
Daily:
â–¡ Check Sentry for errors
â–¡ Monitor database connection
â–¡ Check API response times

Weekly:
â–¡ Analyze tree usage stats
â–¡ Check how many run analysis
â–¡ Track avg time to "investor ready"
â–¡ Monitor user feedback

Monthly:
â–¡ Review scoring accuracy
â–¡ Iterate on recommendations
â–¡ Update dimensions if needed
```

---

## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES CHECK

Make sure production has:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://prod...  âœ…
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...               âœ…
REDIS_URL=redis://...               âœ…
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://...     âœ…
```

---

## FINAL VERIFICATION

âœ… Code pushed to git
âœ… Vercel deployment successful
âœ… Database migration applied
âœ… API endpoints responding
âœ… UI components rendering
âœ… Freja integration working
âœ… No errors in Sentry
âœ… Real user can run analysis

---

## ðŸŽ‰ YOU'RE LIVE!

Your production system now has:

âœ… **68-dimension analysis** analyzing companies
âœ… **Readiness Tree** visualizing investor requirements
âœ… **Action Planner** showing concrete next steps
âœ… **Freja AI** coaching founders through each branch
âœ… **Complete automation** building trees after analysis

---

## NEXT STEPS AFTER GOING LIVE

1. **Tell users!** - Launch announcement, social media
2. **Gather feedback** - What do they think?
3. **Monitor metrics** - Track usage and improvements
4. **Iterate** - Based on feedback, improve the system
5. **Scale** - Add more features over time

---
